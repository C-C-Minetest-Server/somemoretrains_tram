# Trams for Advtrains

This mod adds trams to Advtrains, with codes and sounds adapted from subway trains. They support displaying line numbers (0-9 and X), and have four liveries, red, green, blue, and yellow. The tram's maximum speed is 8 m/s.

This mod is an extract (technically, but this is the only mod in the modpack at the time) of [APercy's some more trains mod](https://github.com/APercy/some_more_trains).
